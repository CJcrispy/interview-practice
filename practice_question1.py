'''
Find the kth largest element in a number stream
Design a class to efficiently find the Kth largest element in a stream of numbers. 
The class should have the following two things:​

1. The constructor of the class should accept an integer array containing initial numbers from the stream and an integer K.

2. The class should expose a function add(int num) which will store the given number and return the Kth largest number.

  def __init__(self, nums, k):
    self.k = k
    # add the numbers in the min heap
    for num in nums:
      self.add(num)

  def add(self, num):
    # add the new number in the min heap
    heappush(self.minHeap, num)

    # if heap has more than 'k' numbers, remove one number
    print(" Heap: ", self.minHeap)
    print("K: ", self.k)
    if len(self.minHeap) > self.k:
      heappop(self.minHeap)

    # return the 'Kth largest number
    return self.minHeap[0]
